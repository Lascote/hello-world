Definition and Usage
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.

Tips and Notes
Tip: The <div> element is very often used together with CSS, to layout a web page.

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element. However, this can be changed with CSS.
